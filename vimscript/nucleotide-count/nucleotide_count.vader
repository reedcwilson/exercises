Before:
  unlet! expected

Execute (empty strand):
  let expected = {
        \ 'A': 0,
        \ 'C': 0,
        \ 'G': 0,
        \ 'T': 0,
        \ }
  AssertEqual expected, NucleotideCount('')

Execute (strand with repeated nucleotide):
  let expected = {
        \ 'A': 0,
        \ 'C': 0,
        \ 'G': 7,
        \ 'T': 0,
        \ }
  AssertEqual expected, NucleotideCount('GGGGGGG')

Execute (strand with multiple nucleotides):
  let expected = {
        \ 'A': 20,
        \ 'C': 12,
        \ 'G': 17,
        \ 'T': 21,
        \ }
  AssertEqual expected, NucleotideCount('AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC')

Execute (strand with invalid nucleotides):
  let expected = 'invalid nucleotide in strand'
  AssertThrows call NucleotideCount('AGXXACT')
  AssertEqual expected, g:vader_exception
